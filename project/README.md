# Freelance Linguist Web App  
This full-stack web application was developed as the final project for the Web Services and Applications module. It demonstrates the integration of front-end and back-end technologies to build a dynamic, database-driven system. The application enables users to manage a list of freelance linguists, supporting core CRUD operations: viewing, adding, updating, and deleting records. The front end is built using HTML, Bootstrap, and jQuery, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface. The back end is powered by a Flask-based REST API, which handles data transactions and communicates with a MySQL database via a custom Data Access Object (DAO) layer. AJAX is used to enable asynchronous interaction between the client and server. The application is deployed on PythonAnywhere, showcasing practical skills in full-stack development, RESTful API design, and cloud-based deployment.

This project extends the sample code provided in the module by incorporating additional features. It utilises two tables instead of one - a linguists table and a rates table - which are joined using LinguistID as the primary key. Additionally, a search bar has been added to enable users to filter the results. Finally, Bootstrap is used to enhance the webpage‚Äôs design, creating a more cohesive and polished appearance.

I chose the theme of a linguist database because I work as a Translation Project Manager. Currently, when selecting linguists for projects, we use Google Sheets to query the information we have on record. However, I believe we would greatly benefit from using a dedicated database ‚Äî albeit a much more detailed one than the example showcased here. Using a theme related to my everyday work helped me view the application from a user‚Äôs perspective and better understand the features and functionalities that would be needed.

## üóÇ Project Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `server.py` | The main Flask application. It defines the REST API routes and integrates with the DAO and HTML template. |
| `linguistDAO.py` | A Python Data Access Object (DAO) module that handles all interactions with the MySQL database. |
| `linguistfinder.html` | A front-end HTML template that provides a web interface for interacting with the linguist database using AJAX. |
| `dbconfig.py` | Contains database configuration details such as connection parameters, used by the DAO to establish database connections. |
| `requirements.txt`| Lists all Python dependencies needed to run the application (used for quick setup in virtual environments or deployment). |
| `db-backup.sql`| The database to import if you are running the application locally. |

## üîß Technologies Used

- **Python** & **Flask** ‚Äì Backend and REST API
- **MySQL** ‚Äì Database
- **HTML/CSS + Bootstrap** ‚Äì Front-end styling
- **JavaScript (jQuery)** ‚Äì AJAX requests and dynamic UI updates
- **PythonAnywhere** ‚Äì Hosting environment

---

## üöÄ Features

- View all linguists in a styled table
- Create new linguists (auto-increment ID)
- Update existing linguist information
- Delete linguists
- Filter and load individual linguists via API route (`/linguists/<id>`) or through the search box

---

## üìÅ File Details

### `server.py`
- Starts a Flask server
- Serves the front-end HTML on `/`
- Provides RESTful routes for:
  - `GET /linguists` ‚Äì Get all linguists
  - `GET /linguists/<id>` ‚Äì Get a linguist by ID
  - `POST /linguists` ‚Äì Add a new linguist
  - `PUT /linguists/<id>` ‚Äì Update an existing linguist
  - `DELETE /linguists/<id>` ‚Äì Delete a linguist
- Communicates with the MySQL database via `linguistDAO.py`

### `linguistDAO.py`
- Contains the `linguistDAO` class
- Connects to a MySQL database using credentials from `dbconfig.py`
- Implements CRUD operations:
  - `getAll()`, `findByID()`, `create()`, `update()`, and `delete()`
- Converts query results into dictionaries for easy JSON conversion

### `linguistfinder.html`
- Web UI for viewing and managing linguists
- Uses jQuery to make AJAX calls to the Flask backend
- Contains form inputs for Name, Email, Target Locale, Per-Word Rate and Hourly Rate.
- Shows a table of all linguists
- Target locale dropdown includes a hardcoded list of accepted languages `fr-FR`, `es-LA`, `ru-RU`, etc.

## ‚úÖ Setup Instructions for Running the Application Locally.

1. **Clone the repo**
2. Import the database file db-backup.sql from the repo to MySQL
3. Add your DB credentials in `dbconfig.py`
4. Install required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Run your app:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

## üåê Live Demo

You can also view and interact with the project here:  
üëâ **[https://myleshenehan.pythonanywhere.com/](https://myleshenehan.pythonanywhere.com/)**

This is hosted on [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/), where the Flask backend and MySQL database are deployed in a live environment.

## üîÆ Areas for Further Development
- Add authentication and user roles (e.g., Admin vs Viewer).
- Add more restrictions around input values and provide warnings to users if the inputs don't align with the schema of the database.
- - Improve search filtering with autocomplete or advanced filters (e.g., by rate or language).
