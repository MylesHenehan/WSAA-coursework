This folder contains the three written assignments submitted for the *Web Services and Applications* module at Atlantic Technological University (ATU). Each assignment involves working with web-based APIs or services using Python.

## üìÅ Contents

### 1. **assignment2-carddraw**  
This program interacts with the [Deck of Cards API](https://deckofcardsapi.com/) to simulate dealing a hand of 5 playing cards.  
It analyses the resulting hand and displays a message congratulating the user based on the combination they draw (e.g., pairs, three-of-a-kind, etc.).

### 2. **assignment03-cso**  
This script retrieves data from the [Central Statistics Office (CSO)](https://data.cso.ie/) for the **Exchequer Account (Historical Series)**.  
It uses Python's `requests` module to fetch the dataset in JSON-stat format and stores the output into a file named `cso.json`.

### 3. **assignment04-github**  
A Python script that:
- Reads a file from a private GitHub repository using a Github authentication key.
- Replaces every instance of the name "Andrew" with the user's name  
- Commits the changes and pushes them back to the repository. 

This assignment demonstrates integration with GitHub using the `PyGithub` package.
